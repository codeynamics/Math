#This code generates Sierpinski's triangle when given 4 inputs. 3 inputs in cartesian coordinates (p,x),(q,y),(r,z).
#Or if you want an equilateral triangle, you can just specify xx, which is the max value in x and y coordinates.
#Then 1 more inout is given (j,k), which is the initial guess point. 
#by default, the no. of iterations is taken as 100000, you can change it as you like.

#The concept behind the working of this code is that, 3 initial points are taken in a cartesian space and a 4th point is assumed in a random place.
#Now a random point out of the initial 3 points is taken and the mid point between the taken random point and chosen 4th point is the new 4th point. 
#Again a random point out of the 3 is taken and the mid point between 4th point and the randomly chosen new point is the new 4th point. 
#This process is repeated for all iterations and this will give a Sierpinski's triangle Fractal. 

#The beauty is that, even if you take random guess very far away from the initial triangle, the fractal triangle would still form.
